1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

It’s  one of the JavaScript libraries you can use for building applications. Thanks to React when one piece of UI is updated then only the changes are made only wherever they are necessary without updating whole page and other areas (that’s why application is much faster). React is flexible so can be used with another libraries and frameworks. 


2. What does it mean to think in react?

It means you can break down and nest your components, you have to visualize your application prior to build it so you can know what parts (components)  you need etc.


3. Describe state.

State is changing data. When state is changed the component will re-render, so information you can see on the screen will change too.


4. Describe props.

Props are arguments that passed through Reacts components.


5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are anything that can affect something outside of the scope of the function being executed.
We can sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes, but using [].
